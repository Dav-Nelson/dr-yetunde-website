                    Dr. Yetunde Abioye is a dynamic Veterinary Doctor working in transboundary fields for over ten (10) years. 
                    Currently, she works at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) as a Senior Veterinary Officer. 
                    At the NCDC she leads the One Health Coordination Unit in the One Health Division of the Department of Surveillance and Epidemiology. 
                    In addition to her role, she is the National Incident Manager of the Lassa fever Technical Working Group (TWG) where she coordinates preparedness, readiness, response and recovery from annual outbreaks of Lassa fever.

                    Prior to working with the NCDC, she held a role as the Project Assistant in one of the partners of the First Nigeria Fleming Fund Consortium, LifeStock Management Services Ltd. 
                    In this role she provided support across the final phase of the AMR country grant implementation led by Mott MacDonald in 2021 in addition to providing support in other concurrently running projects.

                    In 2018, she was selected to be a part of the prestigious NVRI-NEF Toxicology Internship program and collaborated with colleagues across four (4) African countries (within an Intensive 90 days period). 
                    After her one year National Youth Service in 2017, she was awarded the State and Presidential National Youth Service award in 2017and 2021 respectively through her personal community development project. 
                    The experience and skills gained in project proposal, implementation and strategic commissioning of the project led her to a career in public health.

                    Her interest cuts across Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), Food Safety, Toxicology, Zoonotic and Transboundary diseases. 
                    She is looking for collaborations on Global One Health issues in areas of Policy, Vaccine research, Transboundary Zoonotic Diseases, Toxicology, Implementation Research, Risk Communication and Community Engagements. 
                    Nevertheless, she is open to exploring uncharted frontiers and gaining new skills and experiences.
